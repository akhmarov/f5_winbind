This is a fix for mod_auth_ntlm_winbind Apache module which enables
proper handling of F5 BIG-IP TMOS health check (HTTP) requests. By
default BIG-IP sends basic authorization and awaits for response with
NTLM authorization header. By default winbind module checks for basic
authorization in request and basic authorization in config file.
